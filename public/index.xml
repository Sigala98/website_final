      <description>2018 NFL Season For this firest project, I wanted to anaylize data on the NFL. Ever since I was a child, I have always been invested in the NFL. I love football and the amount of statistics that are involed in it. In these two datasets, I have all 2018 NFL season games with a variety of stats, such as scores, win probability, ELO rating, and much more all coming from FiveThirtyEight.</description>
