# **Using re.findall on Python** 

### The re.findall function in python is a useful function that can help find text within strings. Heres an example!

```{python}
import re
string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"
re.findall(r"\d+",string1)
```

### Lets try something a little more complicated... Lets use re.findall to find mac addresses within this string. 
```{python}
string2="Jan 13 00:48:59: DROP service 68->67(udp) from 213.92.153.167 to 69.43.107.219, prefix: \"spoof iana-0/8\" \ (in: eth0 69.43.112.233(38:f8:b7:90:45:92):68 -> 217.70.100.113(00:21:87:79:9c:d9):67 UDP len:576 ttl:64) \ Jan 13 12:02:48: ACCEPT service dns from 74.125.186.208 to firewall(pubnic-dns), prefix: \"none\" \ (in: eth0 74.125.186.208(00:1a:e3:52:5d:8e):36008 -> 140.105.63.158(00:1a:9a:86:2e:62):53 UDP len:82 ttl:38) \Jan 13 17:44:52: DROP service 68->67(udp) from 172.45.240.237 to 217.70.177.60, prefix: \"spoof iana-0/8\" \(in: eth0 216.34.90.16(00:21:91:fe:a2:6f):68 -> 69.43.85.253(00:07:e1:7c:53:db):67 UDP len:328 ttl:64) \Jan 13 17:52:08: ACCEPT service http from 213.121.184.130 to firewall(pub-nic), prefix: \"none\" \(in: eth0 213.121.184.130(00:05:2e:6a:a4:14):8504 -> 140.105.63.164(00:60:11:92:ed:1b):80 TCP flags: ****S* len:52 ttl:109)"

re.findall(r'(?:[0-9a-fA-F]:?){12}',string2)
```

### Awesome right? But how does it work? 

#### Here are some of the syntax

"d= any number (a digit)"

"D= anything but a number (a non-digit)	"

"s = space (tab,space,newline etc.)"

"S= anything but a space

"w = letters (Match alphanumeric character, including "_")	$ match end of a string"

"W =anything but letters (Matches a non-alphanumeric character excluding "_")	"

". = anything but letters (periods)"

### With the syntax all you got to do is slap them together and voil√†! You can now find text within a string !
